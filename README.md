# Image-Classification-with-Flask-TensorFlow-and-Docker
This project implements a web application for image classification using a deep learning model based on the ResNet50 architecture. The project uses Flask as the web framework, TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the model, Docker for containerization, and Prometheus along with Grafana for monitoring and metric visualization.
